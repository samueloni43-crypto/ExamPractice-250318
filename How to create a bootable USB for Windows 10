To create a bootable USB for Windows 10, first, get a USB drive with at least 8GB of free space.
Then, download the Media Creation Tool from Microsoft's website or a tool like Rufus with a Windows 10 ISO file. Run the tool, select your USB drive, and it will copy the Windows 10 files to the USB. 
Insert the USB into your PC, restart, and choose the USB drive as the boot device. Finally, follow the prompts to install Windows 10.
